- Read through Chatper 1: Introduction to Robotics of "Robot Modelling and control" by Spong
- Spent a bunch of time figuring out the correct format to log notes to github.
- Experimented with Jekyll and Hugo, both of which sucked at rendering LaTex
- Finally after much experimentation Quarto seemed like a good option
- This is a sample file using quarto's math rendering [link](../test/math.qmd)
