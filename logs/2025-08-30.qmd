## 1.1 History
The very first robots (or so called ***non-servo robots***) didn't have any feedback in place. They were basically
issued sequence of commands, .e.g. Move to point A, Close gripper, Move to point B, usually with hard mechanical
stops or limit switches but there wasn't any real feedback

## 1.2 Components and Structure of robots

### 1.2.1 Symbolic representation of robots
Basically robots are kinematic chains, which are made up of links and joints. These joints can be revolute (R), or 
prismatic (P). The axis of rotation, or axis of translation is denoted by z

### 1.2.2 Degrees of freedom and workspace

[Degrees of freedom]{.underline}

So actually, when we talk about degrees of freedom for a kinematic mechanism, (think four bar linkage) the 
degrees of freedom doesn't directly equate to the number of joints, and is given by the [Gruebler's formula]{.mark},

$$
F = 3 (n - 1) - 2L - H
$$

where:

- $F$ = number of degrees of freedom  
- $n$ = total number of links including the fixed base  
- $L$ = total number of lower pairs (1 DOF such as pins and sliding joints)  
- $H$ = total number of higher pairs (2 DOF such as cam and gear joints)


You can refer here for more details: [source](https://ezymechanic.blogspot.com/2015/07/grueblers-equation-for-calculating.html)

Having said that, for a lot of the industrial manipulators, they are designed in a way that the joints are mostly independent of each other
and thus [number of degrees of freedom == number of joints]{.mark}. For a robot to reach 3D space with arbitrary orientation, it must have ***atleast 6DOFs*** 
i.e. 3 for position and 3 for orientation. If a robot has more than 6 DOF, then its called a ***kinematically redundant chain*** -- which is especially useful 
if we have to avoid obstacles.

[Workspace]{.underline}

Okay, with that out of the way, lets talk of workspace. So by definition, its the total volume swept by the _end effector_ as it executes all possible motions.
The shape of this volume depends on the robot geometry and the limits on the joints (for example a revolute joint might have less than 360 degree rotation).
Its often broken down into 
1. **reachable workspace** --> Entire set of points we can physically reach
2. **dextorous workspace** --> Subset of the workspace, where we can reach with arbitrary orientation

### 1.2.4 Wrist and End effectors

So far we have discussed the different kinematic configurations of a robot, and what they are typically describing is a **Robot ARM**.
For the robot to do anything meaningful we need an **end effector / hand / EoAT (end of arm tooling)**. Typically these EoATs are grippers, but also can be more complex
depending on the need of the task. [So a wrist then is anything that comes _**between**_ the ARM and the EoAT]{.mark}

One interesting thing to note is that:

- The ARM is usally responsible for the positional degrees of freedom
- The WRIST typically deals with the orientational degrees of freedom

Wrists are also typically spherical, by that I mean, the roll/pitch/yaw axes all intersect at the same point. Here's a synbolic representation of a wrist
